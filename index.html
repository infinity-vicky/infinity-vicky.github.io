        <p>Hi, I'm Vicky Zheng, and this blog is my personal corner on the web. It's where I collect my thoughts, share the occasional project, and try to make sense of the chaos that is computer science.</p>
        <p>There's no deep knowledge-sharing agenda (yet), but if you're curious about my journey or just want to see what I’ve been playing around with, feel free to explore!</p>
